## load packages
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))

# Part 2: Writing functions
In this part, I will write some functions that do something useful to pieces of Gampminder data, the detailed instructions listed [here](http://stat545.com/Classroom/assignments/hw06/hw06.html).

The workflow can be divided into 4 steps, basically followed the instruction of [this link](http://stat545.com/block012_function-regress-lifeexp-on-year.html).

## Create a data frame to work with

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(gapminder))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggplot2))
```

I filtered Canada from the data frame.

```{r}
country_filtered <- "Canada"
country_data <- gapminder %>%
  filter(country == country_filtered)
knitr::kable(country_data, align = 'c')
```

Write a function can generate linear regression plot, and then plot the data of Canada.

```{r}
lin_fit_plot <- function(dat, offset = 1952, country){
  ggplot(dat,aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  ggtitle(paste("Linear regression of", country , "life expectancy from 1952 to 2007")) +
  # the classic dark-on-light ggplot2 theme
  theme_bw() +
  # title is centerd, title size is adjusted
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 12,hjust = 0.5))  
}
lin_fit_plot(country_data, country = "Canada")
```

## Get some code that works

In this part, I will fit the linear model by using `lm()`, here is the [lm() documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.5.1/topics/lm), and estimate coefficients by using `coef()`, here is the  [coef() documentation](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/stats/versions/3.5.1/topics/coef). To make more sense of the intercept, I restrict the earliest year is 1952 by using `I()` funciton here, which inhibits interpretation/conversion of objects.

```{r}
earliestyear <- 1952
country_fit <- lm(lifeExp ~ I(year - earliestyear), country_data)
# a named vector of coefficients
coef(country_fit)
```


## Turn working code into a function

In this part, we turn the code from last part into a function, which can estimate the coefficients of a model. To make the column name more readable, `setNames` is introduced.

```{r}
# set a default year = 1952
country_linfit <- function(dat, offset = 1952) {
  fit <- lm(lifeExp ~ I(year - offset), dat )
  setNames(coef(fit), c("intercept", "slope"))
}
# function testing
country_linfit(country_data)
```

Here we get the exactly same result as before, which means the funciton works, then we can go on to next step!

## Test on other data and in a clean workspace

I cleared workspace first( [reference here](http://stat545.com/block012_function-regress-lifeexp-on-year.html)), to avoid the mistake that accidentally relying on objects that were lying around in the workspace during development but that are not actually defined in your function nor passed as formal arguments.

Now let's choose other countries to test the funciton. I created a *countrytest_data* function to filter the country data from Gapminder.

```{r}
countrytest_data <- function(country_test){
  gapminder %>% filter(country == country_test)
}
# CHoose Australia
countrytest1_data <- countrytest_data("Australia")
knitr::kable(countrytest1_data, align = 'c')
```

Testing on the linear regression plot function and get the coefficients function.

```{r}
lin_fit_plot(countrytest1_data, country = "Australia")
country_linfit(countrytest1_data)
```

The linear fit is good for the previous example. Let's try another country, such as Zimbabwe.

```{r}
# country data filter function
countrytest2_data <- countrytest_data("Zimbabwe")
knitr::kable(countrytest2_data, align = "c")
```

Testing on the linear regression plot function and get the coefficients function.

```{r}
lin_fit_plot(countrytest2_data, country = "Zimbabwe")
country_linfit(countrytest2_data)
```

From this plot, it can be seen that this linear fit is comically bad. Let's try quadratic regression instead, the quadratic regression performs better than linear regression in most cases.

The same as previous step, make a function which can get the coefficients first.

```{r}
le_qua_fit <- function(dat, offset = 1952){
  the_quafit <- lm(lifeExp ~ I(year - offset) + I((year - offset)^2), dat)
  setNames(coef(the_quafit), c("intercept","poly 1","poly 2"))
}
le_qua_fit(countrytest2_data)
```

After that create a function which can plot the quadratic regression.

```{r}
qua_fit_plot <- function(dat, offset = 1952, country){
  ggplot(dat,aes(x = year, y = lifeExp)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm",formula = y ~ I(x - offset) + I((x - offset)^2), se = FALSE) +
  ggtitle(paste("Quadratic regression of", country , "life expectancy from 1952 to 2007")) +
  # the classic dark-on-light ggplot2 theme
  theme_bw() +
  # title is centerd, title size is adjusted
  theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 12,hjust = 0.5))  
}
qua_fit_plot(countrytest2_data, country = "Zimbabwe")
```

After comparison with linear regression, the quadratic regression works better.

# Part 4: Work with the singer data

## Introduction to Singer
Singer is a data package that contains an excerpt from the [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/) desighed for teaching purpose.

```{r}
## installation
# install.packages("devtools")
## install singer from github
# devtools::install_github("JoeyBernhardt/singer")
## load singer
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(singer))
## install ggmap
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("dkahle/ggmap")
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggmap))
```

### Familiar with singer_locations

The singer_locations dataframe in the singer package contains geographical information stored in two different formats: 
  (1). as a (dirty!) variable named city; 
  (2). as a latitude / longitude pair (stored in latitude, longitude          respectively). 

Let's familiar with the raw data first.

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(singer_locations))
dim(singer_locations)
summary(singer_locations)
```


### Filtering data
As we can see the data above is a little messy, because it contains lots of NA in each column, To clean up this dataset, Let's do filtering first, use `drop_na()` to drop rows containing missing values

```{r}
singerloc_filtered <- singer_locations %>%
  # filter the NA data
  drop_na() %>%
  select(latitude, longitude, name, city)
knitr::kable(head(singerloc_filtered))
dim(singerloc_filtered)
```

## Geocoding API
Because `register_google` is not in the CRAN version, we need to install the current version from github, using `remotes::install_github("dkahle/ggmap")` or `devtools::install_github("dkahle/ggmap")`.

For more information about ggmap, please check [reference 1](https://github.com/dkahle/ggmap) and [reference 2](https://github.com/dkahle/ggmap/issues/191), also to use the Geocoding API, you must get an API key first, click [Geocoding API](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/?__utma=102347093.1350953850.1541400936.1541401784.1541401784.1&__utmb=102347093.0.10.1541401784&__utmc=102347093&__utmx=-&__utmz=102347093.1541401784.1.1.utmcsr=(direct)|utmccn=(direct)|utmcmd=(none)&__utmv=-&__utmk=122929547&_ga=2.59821423.376122712.1541400936-1350953850.1541400936#get-started) to get one, [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/get-api-key) is the detail steps to get an API key and how to add restrictions.

```{r}
# install ggmap
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("dkahle/ggmap")
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(ggmap))
register_google(key = 'AIzaSyDvkwT7TOx1kJr8aOl2p4LcgqmgXDHHB8A')
```


The function revgeocode from the ggmap library allows us to retrieve some information for a pair (vector) of longitude, latitude (warning: notice the order in which you need to pass lat and long). 

## Tasks
### TASK 1

*Use `purrr` to map latitude and longitude into human readable information on the band's origin places. Notice that revgeocode(... , output = "more") outputs a dataframe, while revgeocode(... , output = "address") returns a string.*

Here we need to map over multiple inputs(latitude, longitude) simultaneously, so we use [`map2()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/purrr/versions/0.2.5/topics/map2) from `purrr` package. [revgeocode](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/ggmap/versions/2.6.1/topics/revgeocode) reverse geocodes a longitude/latitude location using Google Maps.

Because the filtered dataframe still has 4129, it will cost lots of time to query the google cloud plateform, we only use the first 20 rows in this example.

```{r message=FALSE}
singerloc_filtered20 <- singerloc_filtered[1:20,]
# Use ggmap get the locations
ggmap_locations <- map2_chr(singerloc_filtered20$longitude,
                            singerloc_filtered20$latitude, 
                            ~ revgeocode(as.numeric(c(.x, .y))))
```

Now we compare the singer location obtained by ggmap and the original singer location in singer_locations dataframe. Here we use the `cbind` function to combine data frames side-by-side.

```{r}
# combine data frames side by side
singer_city <- singerloc_filtered20$city
cityggmap_compare <-cbind(singer_city, ggmap_locations)
# display table in plot
tt <- ttheme_default(
  # Use the smaller text size
  # Alternate the row fill colours
  core = list(fg_params=list(cex = 0.6),
              bg_params=list(fill=c("lightyellow","lightblue"))), 
  colhead = list(fg_params=list(cex = 0.6)), 
  rowhead = list(fg_params=list(cex = 0.6)), rows=NULL)
# show the first 15 columns of the comparison
grid.arrange(tableGrob(head(cityggmap_compare,15),
                       rows = NULL,theme = tt),
             nrow = 1, top = "original city vs. singer location obtained by ggmap")
```

### TASK 2
*Check wether the place in city corresponds to the information you retrieved.*
To seperate the word in singer_city column, we use `boundary()`, which matches boundaries between characters, lines, sentences or words. It’s most useful with `str_split()`.
Use `setequal()` to check the correctness of the information.

```{r}
cityggmap_compare <- data.frame(cityggmap_compare)
# tranfer to lowercase and split by word
singercity_lower <- cityggmap_compare$singer_city %>%
  str_to_lower() %>% 
  str_split(pattern = boundary("word"))
# tranfer to lowercase and split by word
ggmaploc_lower <- cityggmap_compare$ggmap_locations %>%
  str_to_lower() %>% 
  str_split(pattern = boundary("word"))

# check the correctness
setequal(singercity_lower, ggmaploc_lower)
```

As we can see, not all the place in city corresponds to the information retrieved before. Now we use `intersect` to make a further look.
Here we define the singer_city in lower case at least match 1 word in ggamp_locations in lower case. After that we combine the correctness with the previous ggmap_compare data frame to vertify the correctness.

```{r}
correctness <- map2(singercity_lower, ggmaploc_lower, 
                    ~intersect(.x, .y)) %>% 
  map(function(l) {
    return(length(l) >= 1)
  })
combine_correctness <-cbind(singer_city, ggmap_locations, correctness)
knitr::kable(combine_correctness)
```

However, it can be noticed that some of the FALSE answer are uncorrect, since we ignore the abbreviation of some states also works. Here is the updated version.

```{r}
patterns <- c("new york" = "ny", "pennsylvania" = "pa", "california" = "ca")
resingercity_lower <- singercity_lower %>%
   map(str_replace_all, patterns)
reggmaploc_lower <-ggmaploc_lower %>%
   map(str_replace_all, patterns)
recheck <- map2(resingercity_lower, reggmaploc_lower, 
                    ~intersect(.x, .y)) %>% 
  map(function(l) {
    return(length(l) >= 1)
  })
recombine_correctness <-cbind(singer_city, ggmap_locations, recheck)
knitr::kable(recombine_correctness)
```

Now there is only one FALSE left, and it's reasonable.

### TASK 3 : Data visualization
*Give a look to the library leaflet and plot some information about the bands.*

To make the plot more concise, we only visualize the first 20 rows of the filtered singer_locations(no NA) data frame, the map shows the locations of each singer.

```{}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(leaflet))

singerloc_filtered20 %>%
  leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(~longitude, ~latitude, popup = ~as.character(city), 
             label = ~as.character(city)) %>%
  addProviderTiles("Esri.WorldImagery")
```


Because the interactice map works in Rmd and html version, to take a look of the effect, gif version is applied here, to see more about this map, please run it in  R.
